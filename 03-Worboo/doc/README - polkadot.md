# Worboo ¬∑ Dot Your Future Submission Dossier

Welcome to the Worboo Polkadot hackathon package. This document is written for judges, mentors, and contributors who need a concise summary of the project, its architecture, and the steps required to evaluate it during **Dot Your Future: Create, Connect, Transform**.

---

## 1. Project Snapshot

- **Track:** ‚ÄúBuild the next generation of Web3 experiences‚Äù (Moonbeam/Moonbase REVM focus).
- **Tagline:** _Daily language quests with on-chain rewards and collectible cosmetics._
- **Status:** MVP complete. Frontend, contracts, and documentation are aligned to Moonbase Alpha. Optional ZK proof system ready for v2 integration.

### Why Polkadot?
Moonbeam‚Äôs REVM execution layer allows Solidity contracts to run with minimal friction, letting us retain Hardhat tooling and deliver fast. Future roadmap items (cross-chain rewards, pallet integrations) will leverage Polkadot‚Äôs XCM and PVM ecosystems.

## 2. Architecture Overview

| Component | Description | Key Tech |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Smart Contracts** (`packages/contracts`) | `WorbooRegistry`, `WorbooToken`, `WorbooShop` written in Solidity 0.8.24, tested with Hardhat + ethers v6. | Hardhat, Ignition, OpenZeppelin |
| **Frontend** (`react-wordle`) | React SPA with RainbowKit/wagmi for wallet login, Moonbase chain config, shop UI, and player dashboards. | React, RainbowKit, Tailwind CSS |
| **Off-chain (optional)** | Halo2-based proof workers (original ZK prototype). Not required for MVP but maintained for future iterations. | Rust, wasm-pack |

See [`mvp-architecture.md`](mvp-architecture.md) for detailed data flow diagrams.

## 3. End-to-End Walkthrough

1. **Clone & install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-fork>/worboo.git
   cd 03-Worboo
   npm install --prefix packages/contracts
   npm install --ignore-scripts --prefix react-wordle
   ```
2. **Configure contracts**
   - Fill `packages/contracts/.env` with `PRIVATE_KEY` and Moonbase RPC URL.
   - Compile and test: `npm run compile && npm run test` (from `packages/contracts`).
3. **Deploy to Moonbase Alpha**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/WorbooModule.ts --network moonbase
   ```
   Record the contract addresses output by Ignition.
4. **Configure frontend**
   - Update `react-wordle/.env` with the deployed `WorbooRegistry`, `WorbooToken`, `WorbooShop` addresses.
   - Start the UI: `npm start` (from `react-wordle`).
   - Connect a wallet (RainbowKit prompts Moonbase Alpha), click **Register**, solve the Wordle challenge, and use WBOO rewards in the shop.
5. **Testing scripts**
   - Contracts: `packages/contracts/npm run test`.
   - Targeted frontend tests: `react-wordle/npm test -- --watch=false --testPathPattern="(shop|contracts).test.ts"`.

> **Note:** Legacy CRA tests referencing ZK worker code still require a jest upgrade; they are excluded from judging instructions.

## 4. Judge‚Äôs Checklist

- [ ] Wallet connects on Moonbase Alpha (RainbowKit modal).
- [ ] Registration transaction mined (`PlayerRegistered` event emitted).
- [ ] Winning a Wordle round triggers `recordGame` and updates streak counters.
- [ ] WBOO balance reflects earned rewards (displayed in navbar shop view).
- [ ] Purchasing a cosmetic/chest calls `purchase` and deducts WBOO.
- [ ] Documentation is clear; README + this dossier explain deployment and testing.

Optional extras (stretch goals):
- [ ] Leaderboard / relayer integration (planned but not in MVP).
- [ ] ZK proof submission (present in repo, disabled by default).

## 5. Technical Deep Dive

### WorbooRegistry.sol
- Guards duplicate registration (`AlreadyRegistered`) and day-ordering (`DayNotStrictlyIncreasing`).
- Normalises streak resets when a day is skipped or a loss occurs.
- Emits structured `GameRecorded` events for indexers or off-chain relayers.

### WorbooToken.sol
- Minimal ERC-20 with `GAME_MASTER_ROLE`. Shop contract holds mint+burn rights.
- Tests enforce mint/burn permissions and balance safety.

### WorbooShop.sol
- ERC-1155 with `setItemConfig` controlled by `ITEM_MANAGER_ROLE`.
- Purchases burn WBOO via WorbooToken (`paymentToken.spend`) before minting collectibles.
- Frontend queries inventory via `balanceOfBatch`.

## 7. Roadmap Beyond the Hackathon

1. **Auto-mint relayer**: verify game submissions off-chain, mint WBOO without user triggering additional transactions.
2. **Proof-of-play**: reintroduce the Halo2 proof pipeline, persisting proofs on IPFS and anchoring hashes on-chain.
3. **Cross-chain incentives**: experiment with XCM to reward learners on sibling parachains.
4. **Governance**: transition shop/Treasury management to a DAO once seasons accumulate value.
