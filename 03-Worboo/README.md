# Worboo on Polkadot

An on-chain, gameified Wordle experience for the **Dot Your Future** hackathon. Players solve daily word challenges in the browser, submit results to smart contracts running on **Moonbase Alpha (Polkadot‚Äôs EVM testnet)**, earn the `WBOO` reward token, and unlock cosmetic collectibles inside the Worboo shop.

---

## Highlights

- **Multi-package monorepo**
  - `packages/contracts`: Hardhat + TypeScript workspace with Worboo smart contracts and tests.
  - `react-wordle`: React/RainbowKit frontend, now wired to Moonbase via wagmi + ethers v6.
- **Core contracts (v1 MVP)**
  - `WorbooRegistry`: tracks player registration, daily submissions, streaks.
  - `WorbooToken`: ERC‚Äë20 reward currency with role-gated mint/burn.
  - `WorbooShop`: ERC‚Äë1155 collectibles redeemed with WBOO.
- **TDD first**: Hardhat/Jest specs accompany every contract and service; see the [implementation plan](doc/implementation-plan.md).
- **Hackathon ready docs**: Technical roadmap, deployment notes, and Polkadot background inside `doc/`.

```\n## Repository Map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/contracts/` | Hardhat workspace (contracts, tests, Ignition deployment module, TypeChain outputs). |
| `react-wordle/` | Frontend app with wallet connectivity, Moonbase integration, and UI for the Worboo shop. |
| `doc/` | Hackathon collateral: architecture notes, migration research, implementation plan, and onboarding docs. |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (recommended LTS).
- npm 8+ (uv-supported environment OK).
- Rust toolchain (only needed if you want to rebuild the Halo2 WASM workers).
- A Moonbase Alpha funded wallet (grab DEV tokens from [Moonbeam faucet](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/get-started/networks/moonbase/faucet/)).

### 2. Install dependencies
From repository root:

```bash
npm install --prefix packages/contracts
npm install --ignore-scripts --prefix react-wordle
```

> We skip husky hooks in the CRA app via `--ignore-scripts` because the hackathon workspace may not be a git repo.

### 3. Configure environment

Create `packages/contracts/.env` (copy from `.env.example`) and set:

```ini
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
MOONBASE_RPC=https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network
MOONBEAM_RPC=https://rpc.api.moonbeam.network # optional mainnet promotion
```

For the frontend (`react-wordle/.env`), fill in contract addresses after deployment:

```ini
REACT_APP_WORBOO_REGISTRY=0x...
REACT_APP_WORBOO_TOKEN=0x...
REACT_APP_WORBOO_SHOP=0x...
REACT_APP_RELAYER_HEALTH_URL=http://localhost:8787/healthz
```

> If `REACT_APP_RELAYER_HEALTH_URL` is omitted, the frontend defaults to `/healthz` on the same origin, so local dev can rely on the health server port defined above.

### 4. Compile & test contracts

```bash
cd packages/contracts
npm run compile
npm run test
```

The test suite covers registration edge cases, streak logic, token permissions, and shop purchase flows.

### 5. Deploy to Moonbase Alpha

```bash
# from packages/contracts
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/WorbooModule.ts --network moonbase
npm run export:addresses
```

Populate the frontend `.env` addresses with the resulting deployment output.

### 6. Run the frontend

```bash
cd react-wordle
npm start
```

RainbowKit presents Moonbase Alpha by default. Connect a wallet, register on-chain, and start purchasing items with WBOO.

### 7. (Optional) Start the reward relayer

Grant the `GAME_MASTER_ROLE` to the relayer wallet (so it can mint rewards):

```bash
cd packages/contracts
npx hardhat run --network moonbase scripts/grantGameMaster.ts <tokenAddress> <relayerAddress>
```

Then configure and launch the listener:

```bash
cd ../relayer
cp .env.example .env   # fill in RPC URL, private key, registry & token addresses
npm run start
```

`packages/relayer/.env` fields:

```ini
RELAYER_RPC_URL=https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network
RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xRELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY
RELAYER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x...
RELAYER_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
RELAYER_REWARD_PER_WIN=10
RELAYER_MAX_RETRIES=3
RELAYER_BACKOFF_MS=1000
RELAYER_CACHE_PATH=.cache/processed-events.jsonl
RELAYER_HEALTH_PATH=.cache/health.json
RELAYER_HEALTH_HOST=0.0.0.0
RELAYER_HEALTH_PORT=8787
```

The relayer watches `GameRecorded` events, persists processed hashes to disk (safe for restarts), and mints `WBOO` for victorious players using the reward amount defined in `.env`. The UI navbar displays relayer status so players see pending wins and successful mints in real time. To inspect relayer health from the CLI run:

```bash
cd packages/relayer
npm run status
```

An HTTP endpoint is also exposed at `http://localhost:8787/healthz` (configurable via env) so dashboards or the frontend can read queue depth and heartbeat information.

## Testing & Quality Gates

| Layer | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Smart contracts | `npm run test` (in `packages/contracts`) | Hardhat + ethers v6, deterministic tests for registry/token/shop. |
| Frontend services | `npm test -- --watch=false --testPathPattern="(shop|contracts|words)"` | Runs the curated unit tests (shop utilities, contract config, word helpers). Legacy CRA tests currently require additional polyfills (see ‚ÄúKnown Issues‚Äù). |
| Relayer service | `npm test` (in `packages/relayer`) | Vitest suite covering config parsing, persistence store, and mint retry handler. |
| Relayer health | `npm run status` (in `packages/relayer`) | Prints JSON snapshot covering queue depth, last mint, and cache size. |

### Known Issues

- `react-wordle` ships original ZK worker code that relies on `import.meta`. CRA/Jest defaults stumble on this syntax. We are keeping the original tests untouched; run targeted test patterns as shown above until the test harness is modernised.
- Existing word-list snapshot tests may fail due to timezone/locale; see `src/lib/words.test.ts` for context if you need deterministic indices.

## Smart-Contract Overview

| Contract | Responsibility | Notable Functions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WorbooRegistry` | Player lifecycle & streak tracking | `register`, `recordGame`, `getProfile` |
| `WorbooToken` | ERC-20 reward currency (`WBOO`) | `mintTo`, `spend`, `GAME_MASTER_ROLE` |
| `WorbooShop` | ERC-1155 cosmetics & chests | `setItemConfig`, `purchase`, `balanceOfBatch` |

Contracts are designed for hackathon velocity: upgraded via redeploy, role-managed with OpenZeppelin `AccessControl`, and extensively unit-tested in Foundry-style Hardhat tests.

For a deeper design discussion see [`doc/mvp-architecture.md`](doc/mvp-architecture.md) and [`doc/polkadot-target.md`](doc/polkadot-target.md).

---

## Frontend Notes

- Wallet connection via RainbowKit/wagmi (Moonbase Alpha chain configured in `src/lib/wagmi.ts`).
- Contract accessors encapsulated in `src/services/contracts.ts`.
- Player data + purchases handled by the React Query hook `src/hooks/useWorbooPlayer.ts`.
- Shop utilities (`src/utils/shop.ts`) map static catalog IDs to ERC‚Äë1155 token IDs and filter WBOO-priced items.

---

## Hackathon Submission Checklist

1. ‚úÖ Contracts compiled & tests green (`packages/contracts`).
2. ‚úÖ Frontend connects to Moonbase Alpha, handles on-chain registration, balance display, and purchases.
3. ‚úÖ Documentation refreshed (this README, `doc/README - polkadot.md`, and deployment notes).
4. ‚úÖ Relayer package ready with environment template & reward workflow.
5. üîú Optional: add demo video + screenshots before final submission.

---

## Roadmap

Short term goals are tracked in [`doc/implementation-plan.md`](doc/implementation-plan.md). Highlights:

- Add automated ABI export pipeline from Hardhat to the React app.
- Expand React test coverage once the CRA/Jest toolchain is upgraded.
- Deploy the auto-mint relayer (see `packages/relayer`) and extend it with persistence/indexing (details in [`doc/roadmap-next.md`](doc/roadmap-next.md)).
- Integrate the ZK proof relayer + IPFS pipeline (v2 scope).
- Explore PVM/ink! migration for advanced gameplay and governance.
