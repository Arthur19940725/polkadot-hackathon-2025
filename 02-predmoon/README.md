* the problem the project try to resolve

### Product Motivation

We identified a significant gap in the prediction market space - the lack of user-friendly, mobile-first platforms that make trading knowledge accessible to everyone. Traditional prediction markets are complex and intimidating for new users. We built PredMoon to democratize access to prediction markets through an intuitive Tinder-style interface that simplifies trading decisions.


## Features planned for the Hackathon
* The status of project before participate the Hackathon

Have a polymarket clone version of the Prediction Market Platform.

* Features are planed for the Hackathon

[x] A Tinder-style interface for users to trade their knowledge on-chain.
[x] A smart contract-based prediction market platform that allows users to create, trade, and settle predictions.
[x] A decentralized exchange (DEX) for users to buy and sell predictions.
[x] A community-driven platform where users can connect, trade, and learn from each other.
